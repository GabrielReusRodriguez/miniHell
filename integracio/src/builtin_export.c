On Unix-like operating systems, export is a builtin command of the Bash shell. It designates specified variables and functions to be passed to child processes.

Normally, when you run a command at the bash prompt, a dedicated process is created with its own environment, exclusively for running your command. Any variables and functions you defined before running the command are not shared with new processes â€” unless you explicitly mark them with export.

Syntax 
export [-f] [-n] [name[=value] ...]
